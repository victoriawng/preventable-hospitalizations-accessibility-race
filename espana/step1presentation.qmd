## Does healthcare access affect the number of preventable hospital stays of certain racial groups at the county level?

**Why this matters:**

-   Reduce preventable hospitalizations
-   Equitable resource allocation
-   Focus efforts where help is needed most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## National Data

**Source:** County Health Rankings 2025

**Variables of Interest:** - Preventable Hospital Stays, Primary Care Physician Ratio, Uninsured Rate - others things - County-level racial groupings (White Majority vs White Minority)

**Preprocessing Highlights:** - explain how we did white majority vs minority

**Raw Data:**

-   County-level health outcomes(ex)
-   Healthcare access variables(ex)
-   Disaggregated by race

**Cleaned Data:**

-   Filtered and cleaned to complete observations
-   Created "White Majority" vs. "Minority" indicator

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Preventable Hospitalizations by County

```{r}

```

## Regression Analysis of Racial Disparities in Preventable Hospital Stays

**Planned Approach:**

-   Linear regression with interaction terms
-   Outcome: Preventable hospital stays
-   Predictors: Uninsured rate, provider ratio, race group

**Modeling Strategy:**

-   Explore variable selection and regularization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Moving into modeling and interpretation

**Completed:**

-   Defined research question

-   Cleaned and preprocessed dataset

-   Created initial EDA visualizations

**Next Steps:**

-   Fit regression models with race Ã— access interactions
-   Interpret disparities and validate model
-   Create visual summaries and poster
