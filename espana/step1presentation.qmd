## Does healthcare access affect the number of preventable hospital stays of certain racial groups at the county level?

**Why this matters:**

-   Reduce preventable hospitalizations
-   Equitable resource allocation
-   Focus efforts where help is needed most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## National Data

**Source:**\
County Health Rankings 2025

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Variables of Interest:**\
- Preventable Hospital Stays, Primary Care Physician Ratio, Uninsured Rate - others things - County-level racial groupings (White Majority vs White Minority)

**Preprocessing Highlights:**\
- explain how we did white majority vs minority
=======
**Raw Data:**

-   County-level health outcomes(ex)
-   Healthcare access variables(ex)
-   Disaggregated by race

**Cleaned Data:**

-   Filtered and cleaned to complete observations
-   Created "White Majority" vs. "Minority" indicator

## Regression Analysis of Racial Disparities in Preventable Hospital Stays

**Planned Approach:**\
- Linear regression with interaction terms\
- Outcome: Preventable hospital stays\
- Predictors: Uninsured rate, provider ratio, race group

**Modeling Strategy:**\
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Use ....

**Justification:**\
- give reasons
=======
- Explore variable selection and regularization
