## Does healthcare access affect the number of preventable hospital stays of certain racial groups at the county level?

**Why this matters:**

-   Reduce preventable hospitalizations
-   Equitable resource allocation
-   Focus efforts where help is needed most

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## National Data

**Source:**
County Health Rankings 2025

**Raw Data:**

-   County-level health outcomes(ex)
-   Healthcare access variables(ex)
-   Disaggregated by race

**Cleaned Data:**

-   Filtered and cleaned to complete observations
-   Created "White Majority" vs. "Minority" indicator

## Regression Analysis of Racial Disparities in Preventable Hospital Stays

**Planned Approach:**

- Linear regression with interaction terms
- Outcome: Preventable hospital stays
- Predictors: Uninsured rate, provider ratio, race group

**Modeling Strategy:**

- Explore variable selection and regularization

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Moving into modeling and interpretation

**Completed:**

- Defined research question
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Created initial EDA visualizations

**Next Steps:**

- Fit regression models with race Ã— access interactions
- Interpret disparities and validate model
- Create visual summaries and poster
