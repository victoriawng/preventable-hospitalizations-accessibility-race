# notes

# template: quarto, key note...

# don't show entire slide at once (sentence/bullet points transition)
# repetitive language and usage of words and reminders is good for audience!! (don't use synonyms, be simple!)


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# capstone 
# report, poster, and presentation on last day

# audience: optum UHG 

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRESENTATION TIPS

# no table of contents or outline or overview slide (accessible)
# ruins flow and should flow naturally 

# ---motivation and background 
# start with current state of research
# needs for this analysis
# understand the audience 

# creative intro example

# ---overview of data
# main theme of data set
# group features if too many
# don't take screenshot of data or R or console output, put it in bullet points
# use example but not a screenshot, make the table (e.g. knitr, DT, gt)

# ---methods (for applied rather than theory)
# state the methods you used in the analysis
# exp: linear regression, but if more complicated explain a bit
# validation 

# ---presenting results
# use assertion-evidence model
# title of slides should be informative -> key takeaway (can be a sentence, line or two)
# evidence (vis, modelling choices)
# # slide doesn't need to have plot title and slide title
# vis title should describe the analysis (e.g. "covid rates are increasing" NOT "covid timeline)"
# example slide given

# ---discussion (and ending a presentation)
# conclude with a recap of main points of your work
# limitations, future directions (what can you do in the future to be better)
# end with a "discussion" slides 
# never end slide with a lone thank you slide
# put one or two takeaway as final slide (plot or 2 bullet points)
# don't include references
# always include back up slides aka appendix slides for questions
# # my thought: maybe add outline as an appendix for ppl to reference in the future
